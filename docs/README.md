### Supplementary Material Website

This website provides additional visualizations of our multiview iterative diffusion and reconstruction process, and compares our results to the state-of-the-art in Image-to-3D generation. 

You can open the website by opening `index.html` or `additional-visualizations.html` with a browser. We recommend viewing in either Chrome / a Chromium browser (e.g. Edge, Arc, Brave) or Firefox, but not Safari, as Safari has performance issues displaying so many videos. 

Alternatively, you can view the videos directly by navigating the `ours/` and `videos/` directories.
